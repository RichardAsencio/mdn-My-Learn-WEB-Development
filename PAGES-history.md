# Pages History

MDN is a huge and vast site rich with many links on each page. ON previous occassions I have felt overwhelmend or even lost when I start reading a page, then clinking a link to read something, then clicking another link in that second page and so forth. by the time a come back, I cant remember why ended up in this topic how I came to it and where was I in the first place. 

And since I currently do not have a smart solution for this problem, I will just have a chronological list of wepages visited with some thought or descripitions on it. 


Day 0 - Thursday May 14, 2020 

I started with these pages and had them open in different tabs in my Mozilla browser at all times:  

1. [Learn Web Development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) - will pin this one down to track how I go about all the info in this learning area. 
2. [How do I start to design my website? - A Planning Perspective -GOOD Read](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Thinking_before_coding#Conclusion)
3. [Glossary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary)
4. [Learning Area Release Notes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Release_notes)
5. [The Discourse Forum](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Release_notes)
6. [Getting Started With The Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)


These pages I started reading as I moved thru :
[Getting Started With The Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)
then moved to this: 
[Installing Basic Software](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)
then moved to this: 
[How do you set up a local testing server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) but first I need to know: [How The Internet Works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work) and [What is web server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server)

From How the Internet Works I forked into: 
[How The Web Works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works) and [What is the difference between webpage, website, web server, and search engine?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Pages_sites_servers_and_search_engines) and [What is a domain name?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_domain_name)
