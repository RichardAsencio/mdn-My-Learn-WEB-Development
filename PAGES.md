# Pages  

This document will serve as a placeholder to pin the webpages visited on my "Learning the Web with MDN" path, be it as means to go back to anything I want to review as well as to follow my progresion thru the many webpages and content that this vast web dev resources site hosts. I my previous experiences I have found a buit difficult to foloow thru with this resources as they have so many links in each page that if you venture to click a few at a time you might get lost and confused very quickly, with some ten open tabs in your browser.
